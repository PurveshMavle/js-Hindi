JAVA script is single threaded inside it everything is a process


execution context
call stack [a memory] 


********* JAVA script execution context ******
whenever we give code to js it produces at first always i.e Global execution context (this variable is used to refer it eg in js it is empty string whereas in browser it shows window and other things)
Global execution context
Function execution context
Eval execution context (its a property of global ec)

1. phase is memory "creation phase"
2. second phase is execution phase // difference between them is in first phase only memory is allocated to the variables and we cant excute any operation here 

eg.let val1=10
   let val2=5
   Function addNum(num1,num2){
    let total =num1+num2
    return total
   }
   let result1 = addNum (val1,val2)
   let result2 = addNum(10,2)

step 1> global execution/environment: whatever the quantity of the code might be it should be run from global exc and "this" is assigned to it
step 2 (first cycle) -> memory creation phase : all the variables are collected
          for eg in above example in val1 : undefined will stored initially
                                     val2 : undefined will stored initially
                                     addNum : function definition will stored initially
                                     result1:undefined
                                     result2:undefined
step 3 (second cycle) -> execution phase: in this values will assigned and operation are performed for eg in above example in val1:10
                                     val2:5
                                     addNum wil create its own execution context
                                       ( New variable environment+ execution thread )
                                       again the step 1 and step will be repeated for each function call
                                       Memory phase             execution context
                                       val1->undefined          num1 :10
                                       val2->undefined          num2:5
                                       total->undefined         total:15

                                       total is returned to Global execution context

                                       after the value is returned the new execution context that was created that will get delete by itself

                                       result1 :15 // it will get the value

                                       same repeat for second function call of result2

                                       result2 :12
